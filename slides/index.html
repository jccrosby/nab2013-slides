							<li>As a local publishing point for live streaming, with stream split out to multiple CDNs</li>
							<li>To create a linear playlist to stream to a CDN</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<p>Amazon CloudFront, AWS's easy to use CDN, works seamlessly with Adobe Media Server on Amazon Web Services.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Stream Video securely using multiple protocols</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<p><strong>HTTP Streaming</strong> - Reach the widest possible audience by delivering content to Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR applications, and iOS devices. With new HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) to iPad and other iOS devices—plus new protected HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS) for Flash Player supported on Android devices—the video experience can now be delivered smoothly and securely to more devices, with adaptive bitrate support to reach audiences without disruption.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<p><strong>RTMP</strong> — streaming Support adaptive bitrate delivery and stream encryption for live and on-demand streams, along with low-latency real-time communication over industry standard RTMP/RTMPE.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<p><strong>RTMFP</strong> — Achieve real-time, ultralow latency communication with new peer-assisted networking. Reduce bandwidth costs for direct, live, real‐time communication applications such as audio and video chat and multiplayer games. Use RTMFP to realize higher network efficiencies with new application-level multicast support, saving bandwidth and network costs by distributing a stream among peers.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Top reasons to subscribe to Adobe Media Server on Amazon Web Services</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Protected HTTP streaming for iOS</h2>				
					<p>Expand your audience to include iOS devices with HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). With the same media and live streams as those used for Flash Player compatible playback, you can deliver and protect full adaptive bitrate experiences to iOS devices as well as HTML5-enabled browsers.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>On-demand packaging for HTTP</h2>
					<p>Deliver video using HTTP for Flash Player compatible and iOS devices without preparing the assets ahead of time. On-demand packaging makes publishing easier by requiring one set of video files to deliver to multiple devices with or without Flash Player installed.</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h2>Scalable P2P introduction services</h2>
					<p>Increase the capacity and fault tolerance of your interactive media experiences using RTMFP for peer assisted delivery (p2p). Now with new server chaining technology, you can distribute peer introductions across multiple servers. Perfect for multicast streaming, game development or communications apps.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Application multicast</h2>
					<p>Use peer-assisted networking to distribute high-quality, more secure streams among peers, significantly reducing the network load. Use prebuilt tools and Open Source Media Framework (OSMF) to get started quickly and easily.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Enhanced RTMP streaming</h2>
					<p>Enable features such as trick mode playback (fast motion, slow motion, and frame stepping) as well as allow the video player to continue to play buffered video while reconnecting to the server if the connection is lost.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Enhanced RTMP streaming</h2>
					<p>Enjoy faster switching between streams when utilizing RTMP Dynamic Streaming for adaptive bitrate delivery, which improves the user experience during bandwidth fluctuations.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Enhanced RTMP streaming</h2>
					<p>RTMP Dynamic Streaming is a quality of service (QoS) feature that responds to changes in a viewer’s bandwidth or computing resources and quickly switches between bitrates during playback without disruption.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p>Create deep access controls such as domain white and black listing, external server authentication, authorization plug-ins, and other custom applications that protect interactive media experiences.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Multiuser experiences for your audience</h2>
					<p>Deliver breakthrough, engaging environments with enhanced multiuser experiences (such as video chat, Voice over Internet Protocol, video overlays, server-side playlists, and server-side recording), plus deeper interactivity through an extensible development architecture and rich server-side scripting support.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Absolute time code</h2>
					<p>Help ensure that existing time codes persist within media files to allow richer synchronization between streams, improving interactive experiences (such as switching audio tracks or camera angles) with multibitrate and multistream video and synchronized playback events.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Easier implementation</h2>
					<p>Get started right away with easy, out-of-the-box deployment. Adobe Media Server for Amazon Web Services makes it simple with prebuilt features for live, video on demand, and multiprotocol delivery of encrypted media to Flash Player and the Adobe AIR® runtime. Simply configure an Amazon EC2 instance to run a Adobe Media Server Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and get up and running in minutes.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>HTTP Dynamic Streaming</h2>
					<p>Deliver HD-quality video over standard HTTP network infrastructures with HTTP Dynamic Streaming support for both live and on-demand streams. Adobe Media Server on Amazon Web Services provides:
						<ul>
							<li>Live packaging</li>
							<li>Origin support</li>
							<li>DVR support</li>
							<li>Real-time manifests</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>DVR functionality</h2>
					<p>Archive live, high-definition streams on the server and enable HD DVR functionality (instant replay and time shifting) with support for H.264 stream recording for both RTMP and HTTP Dynamic Streaming. Pause a live stream, or seek backwards into the video that was missed.</p>
